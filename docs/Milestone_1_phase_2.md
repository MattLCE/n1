Milestone 1 (M1) - Mirror Implementation Status & Next Steps

## 1. Goal & Success Criteria (Unchanged)
### Goal	
Seamless, encrypted, peer-to-peer sync across two or more replicas, delivering eventual consistency while preserving the append-only, content-addressed data model introduced in M0.

### Must-pass tests
1) First sync of empty â†’ populated vault.
2) Bi-directional sync with >1 conflicting updates resolved deterministically.
3) 500 MB resumable transfer survives mid-stream interruption.
4) Continuous "follow" mode keeps two laptops within 5 s of convergence for 24 h.

### Baseline metrics	
* Throughput â‰¥ 80 % of raw link speed for large files
* latency â‰¤ 3 RTTs for small objects
* CPU â‰¤ 30 % on Apple M-series / AMD Zen3.

### Exit criteria	
* CI green on the above
* docs & examples merged to main
* v0.2.0-m1 tag signed
* release notes posted.

|---------------------------------------------|------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|

| WAL corruption on abrupt power loss         | Low        | High   | `fsync` / `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint`; recovery tool.           |
| Merge rule edge-cases unanticipated         | Med        | Med    | Early property-based fuzz tests; run against seed corpora. |
| Scope creep (e.g. gateway relay)            | Med        | Med    | Defer to M2 "Mesh" milestone.                              |
| **Complexity of Network/Reconnection Logic**| **High**   | **High** | **Add simpler tests, focused logging, step-by-step debug.** |
| **Complexity of Follow Mode State**         | **High**   | **High** | **Fix basic sync/reconnection first, detailed logging.**   |

## 5. Immediate Next Steps (Revised Order)

1.  **Add `TestSyncBasicNetwork`:** Implement a new test in `network_test.go` that performs simple, non-interrupted push and pull operations between the two vaults via the Toxiproxy setup. This will serve as a baseline network functionality check. *(Target: Ensure basic client-server communication over proxied network works)*.
2.  **Debug Reconnection (`TestSyncResumable...`):** Investigate the EOF error during sync resume. Focus on how `mirord` handles client reconnections after the Toxiproxy link is restored. Ensure the server correctly sends the initial `OFFER` message upon reconnection. Add detailed logging in `cmd/mirord/main.go`'s `handleConnection` and the client-side receive logic. *(Target: `TestSyncResumableWithNetworkInterruption` PASSES)*.
3.  **Debug Follow Mode (`TestSyncContinuous...`):** Investigate why data isn't syncing correctly in `--follow` mode. Add detailed logging within the `performFollow` loop in `internal/miror/miror.go` to trace the pull/push cycles, state changes, and message exchanges. Verify interaction with the server (`handleConnection`). *(Target: `TestSyncContinuousWithNetworkChanges` PASSES)*.
4.  **Integrate Merge Logic:** Once basic sync, resume, and follow are working, integrate the merge specification logic (`internal/merge`) into the `Replicator` to handle conflicts correctly.
5.  **Refine Tests:** Enhance tests (`sync_test.go`, `network_test.go`) to cover merge scenarios and potentially add more chaos testing.
6.  **Complete Documentation:** Write user documentation, examples, and architecture diagrams for M1.
