# n1 Project Documentation

Welcome to the central documentation hub for the **n1** project ‚Äì your digital Iron‚ÄëMan suit üõ°Ô∏è.

This `/docs` directory serves as the **source of truth** for the project's mission, design, architecture, decisions, and development practices. It's intended for contributors (human and AI) and anyone interested in the technical underpinnings of n1.

Think of n1 as a personal knowledge & security workbench that lets you collect, encrypt, and query everything you want to keep safe but close at hand.
